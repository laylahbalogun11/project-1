      <p>Some of you might be wandering<q>Who is Allah.</q></p>
         Allah is a supernatural being,the leader of the worlds,
         Univers and the entire sea. Some muslims make mistake 
         that Allah is one of the names of Allah, well it is    
         <strong>NOT</strong>.It is like this because even the
         arab jews call their God Allah.

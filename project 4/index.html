    The name of my school is Ansar-ud-deen college.
    It is located at number 1 Akinbaiye streer, Isolo, Lagos state.
    It is one of the many branches of Ansar-ud-deen in Nigeria.
    Ansar-Ud-Deen College, Isolo, founded 1953, is a lively and warm community where boys and girls are made welcome from
    the time of their arrival. It is a school where academic and technical excellence are encouraged and one in which
    students are able to develop their interests and talents in all areas. The students are proud of their school and value
    its unique character.

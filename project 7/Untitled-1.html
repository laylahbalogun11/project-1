Our curriculum is meticulously structured and delivered through online worksheets and interactive simulations, ensuring students not only understand but excel in math fundamentals. Our instructors are carefully selected and undergo comprehensive training to maintain the highest teaching standards. Unlike traditional home tuitions, which may have an unrestricted number of students, a Codingal class maintains a small group setting with no more than 7 to 8 students from various grades. This approach minimizes competition, fostering a more supportive learning environment, and allows our teachers to provide personalized attention to each student, ensuring individual growth and understanding.":"At Codingal, we believe that effective learning extends beyond homework completion and exam preparation.

It’s common for students to achieve scores of 95% to 100% yet lack a solid grasp of fundamental math concepts. This often leads to difficulties in higher grades as the subject matter becomes more complex. At Codingal, we provide personalized attention to identify and strengthen areas where each student needs improvement. For those who already excel in the basics, our program advances into more complex areas, including preparation for math Olympiads and increasing challenge levels to keep engagement high. Moreover, to prevent boredom and maintain interest for students who might not feel sufficiently challenged by their school curriculum, Codingal offers a variety of stimulating activities like tab-based exercises and interactive puzzles.":"At Codingal, we recognize that scoring high in school exams doesn’t necessarily reflect a child’s true understanding of math.

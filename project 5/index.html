        <h2>HISTORY OF NIGERIA</h2>
        <P>The history of Nigeria can be traced to the earliest inhabitants whose remains date from at least 13,000 BC through
        early civilizations such as the Nok culture which began around 1500 BC. Numerous ancient African civilizations settled
        in the region that is known today as Nigeria, such as the Kingdom of Nri,[1] the Benin Kingdom,[2] and the Oyo
        Empire.[3] Islam reached Nigeria through the Bornu Empire between (1068 AD) and Hausa Kingdom during the 11th
        century,[4][5][6][7] while Christianity came to Nigeria in the 15th century through Augustinian and Capuchin monks from
        Portugal to the Kingdom of Warri.[8] The Songhai Empire also occupied part of the region.[9] Through contact with
        Europeans, early harbour towns such as Calabar, Badagry[10][11] and Bonny emerged along the coast after 1480, which did
        business in the transatlantic slave trade, among other things. Conflicts in the hinterland, such as the civil war in the
        Oyo Empire, meant that new enslaved people were constantly being "supplied".
        
        After 1804, Usman dan Fodio unified an immense territory in his jihad against the superior but quarrelling Hausa states
        of the north, which was stabilised by his successors as the "Caliphate of Sokoto".</P>
        
        <h2>COLONIAL HISTORY</h2>
        <p>igeria's colonial history began with British control in 1861 and the establishment of a British colony in 19141. The
        country gained independence in 1960 and became a republic in 1963. During the colonial period, Nigeria experienced
        ethnic strife and military coups1. The colonial administration went through different phases, including the imposition
        of indirect rule, administrative reform, and constitutional changes2. The journey to independence involved nationalist
        movements, political negotiations, and evolving governance structures3.</p>
